A wrapper for Openweathermap One Call Api v1 -> [Link](https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-api).

### Attention!

I am not owner or maintainer of the API (https://openweathermap.org/api). This is only a wrapper for it.
You need to get an api-key from their site to use the api.

## Requirement

You need a working environment with php >= 8.1 and composer.

## Installation

```zsh
composer require thomasboom89/openweathermap-one-call-api
```

## Usage

Create an instance of the OneCallApi

```php
$httpClient  = new Client();
$httpFactory = new HttpFactory();
$owmoca      = new OneCallApi("YOUR-API-KEY", $httpClient, $httpFactory);

// Optional use caching interface
$pool        = new ArrayAdapter();
$cache       = new Psr16Cache($pool);
$owmoca      = new OneCallApi("YOUR-API-KEY", $httpClient, $httpFactory, $cache, 240);
```

Now you can use it to make a request

```php
// lat , lon , language , unitsystem
try {
    $forecast = $owmoca->getForecast(-78.944450, 19.458971, 'de', OneCallApi\Unit::METRIC);
 } catch (Exception $exception){
    // handle exception
 }
```

You will receive a forecast object

```php
var_dump($forecast);
```
